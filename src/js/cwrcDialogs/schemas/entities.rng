    * Purpose: RELAX NG schema to model CWRC entities
    *
    * Description: A RELAX NG schema to model person entities, organization entities, and place entities.  As well, this omnibus schema also includes "interace
    * annotation" code that is used to generate the entity creation/editing HTML forms (the "CWRC dialogs") for these three type of entities, using the
    * <xs:annotation> element to contain this interface annotation code.
    *
    * Schema design pattern: Although the standard design pattern terminology found in the literature refers to, and is most appropriate for, W3C XML
    * Schema (XSD), there is some applicability when applied to the schema design patterns in RELAX NG (RNG).  The standard four schema design patterns
    * are the following: Russian Doll, Salami Slice, Venetian Blind, and Garden of Eden.  The CWRC entities schema uses the Garden of Eden design with respect
    * to elements, wherein all elements are defined globally (the concept of "type", i.e., simple type and complex type, is only germane to XSD schemas), and all
    * attributes are also defined globally (in the Garden of Eden pattern, type is defined globally, and type can be used to define attribute pattern directives).
    *
    * Interface annotation code: The interface annotation code has the following elements and attributes:
    *  - <xs:annotation>: highest element; introduces start of an interface annotation code block
    *  - <xs:appinfo>: second highest element; wrapper for interface annotation code
    *  - <interface-field>: contains a @path attribute whose value is a Unix-style directory path of the
    *        XML path through the XML tree to the element of interest; branches in the tree can be indicated
    *        via a Boolean "or" using the pipe-divider symbol "|"; contains three child elements: <label>,
    *        <help-text>, and <input>
    *  - <label>: contains an @xml:lang attribute with a value of "en", and the text node value is the
    *        text string that you want the label to display
    *  - <help-text>: contains an @xml:lang attribute with a value of "en", and the text node value is the
    *        help text string you want to see displayed when the user clicks on the icon with a question mark
    *  - <input>: declares the type of form element; values are the following:
    *        - combobox: defines a drop-down menu list (same as dropDown and slider)
    *        - dialogue: this text node value also has a @label attribute with a value of "Add" in the <input>
    *             element; only occurs twice, with "Variant names(s)" (the <variant> element), and "Dates of
    *             existence" (the <dateSingle> element); doesn't appear to have any working function or purpose
    *        - datePicker: used to call a JavaScript library that displays a calendar to select a date value
    *        - dropDown: defines a drop-down menu list (same as combobox and slider)
    *        - header: indicates that the <label> element text node value should have a CSS style applied to it
    *             to make the font larger, as in a header
    *        - slider: defines a drop-down menu list (same as combobox and dropDown)
    *        - textArea: defines a multiline text area box
    *        - textField: defines a single line text field
    *        - readonlyTextField: defines a read-only single line text field
    *  - <values>: can contain a @type attribute with possible values of person, organization, or place; provides
    *        an enumerated list of values for the <input> element types of combobox, dropDown, and slider;
    *        occurs as a child element of <xs:appinfo>; contains a child element of <choice>
    *  - <choice>: a container element that contains the enumerated list of values; contains three child elements:
    *        <value>, <data>, and <a:documentation>
    *  - <value>: contains an @a:en attribute, whose value is what is displayed to the user in the drop-down menu
    *        list; the text node value is the value associated with the element in the @path of the
    *        <interface-field> element; can also have a @default attribute with a value of "yes", to indicate the
    *        default value for the element listed in the @path attribute of the <interface-field> element
    *  - <data>: contains an @a:en attribute with a value of "Specify" (what is displayed to the user in the
    *        drop-down menu list), and a @type attribute with a values of "string"; used to record input from
    *        the user for lists that are open
    *  - <a:documentation>: it appears this was intended to provide help text associated with each value in the
    *        enumerated list that is displayed to the user, but this feature was not implemented in the code
    *  - <interface>: special container element only used by the interface order code block
    *  - <interface-order>: special flag that contains the code that defines the order of the three top-level
    *        elements of <identity>, <description>, and <recordInfo>

*** Revisions ***
     MRB: Thur 16-Apr-2015
     * Added "emic" as an option for contribuing project.
     MRB: Mon 23-Feb-2015
     * Added a new value of "fullNameDirectOrder" to the enumerated list for the @partType attribute; also
     changed the exisiting value of "fullName" to "fullNameInvertedOrder".
     * Added interface annotation code to the <interest> element.
     * Added interface annotation code to the <activity> element.
     * Added interface annotation code to the <occupation> element.
     * Changed the pattern directive for the <resource> element from <optional> to <zeroOrMore>.
     * Changed the pattern directive for the <occupation> element from <optional> to <zeroOrMore>.
     * Changed the pattern directive for the <recordChangeDate> element from <zeroOrMore> to <optional>.
     MRB: Wed 11-Feb-2015
     * Added new introductory schema comments on the interface annotation code.
     * Added interface annotation code to the <recordCreationDate> element.
     * Deleted the interface annotation code for the <originInfo> element, and added new interface annotation
     code to the parent of <originInfo>, the element <recordInfo>; <recordInfo> is defined in three different
     places in the schema (i.e., in recordInfo container elements for each of the person, organization, and
     place entity code blocks).  Making this change makes the labelling hierarchy for the top-level <recordInfo>
     element parallel the labelling structure of the other two top-level elements of <identity> and <description>.
     * Changed the order of the three top-level elements from <recordInfo>, <identity>, and <description>, to
     <identity>, <description>, and <recordInfo> (i.e., moved <recordInfo> from being the first top-level element
     to being the last top-level element).  Also reordered the element and annotation definitions in the schema so
     that they reflect this new sequence order.
     * Added the <interleave> directive around the child elements of the <originInfo> element.
     * Changed the access condition statement in the <accessCondition> element from CC BY-NC 3.0 to CC BY-NC 4.0.
     MRB: Tue 19-Aug-2014: Redefined the regular expression patterns in the <standardDate> element; the regular
     expression patterns allow for Orlando dates in the Orlando legacy date format YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-, and
     YYYY-hyphen (possibly remove in the future if change dates in Orlando person entities to ISO 8601 formatted dates).
     MRB: Fri 01-Aug-2014
     * Revised and simplified the /entity/person/identity/preferredForm/namePart[@partType] attribute so that it only
     has four enumerated values: family, given, fullName, and termsOfAddress; this parallels the enumerated list of values
     that is used in the MODS schema's /mods/name/namePart[@type] attribute (except for the fullName value).
     * Revised and simplifed the /entity/person/description/existDates element: deleted the <dateRange> child element;
     added the @qualifier (approximate, inferred, questionable) attribute to the <standardDate> element; changed the
     <dateType> element's enumerated list of values to birth, death, flourish, establishment, and dissolution.
     * Deleted top-level <relations> element; an entity's relationships with other entities will be established in the RDF
     triplestore.
     * Changed the <projectId> element pattern from an open text field to a closed enumerated list (canwwr, ceww,
     eccji, orlando).
     * Deleted the @xml:id attribute and the 34 references to it (id-attribute); no need for a TEI-inspired reference
     system to mark up particular sections of the spartan entities, because users will be linking to the entire entity, not
     a part of the entity.
     * Deleted elements and attributes that were not being, and would not be, used.
     * Modified many of the annotation statements for both the schema annotation documentation and the interface
     annotation code that provide element/attribute help statements and interface form element labels in the entity
     creation/editing form dialogs.
     * Reordered the element and annotation definitions in the schema so that they are in the sequence we would like
     them to appear in the entity creation/editing form dialogs.
     MRB: Tue 27-May-2014: Added schema code and interface annotation code for a <factuality> element in /entity/*/
     description/factuality, with values of real, fictional, or both (i.e., a mixture of both real and fictional).
     MRB: Tue 22-Apr-2014: Added interface annotation code to render header labels for the four top-level element
     sections: recordInfo, identity, description, and relations.
     MRB: Fri 14-Mar-2014: Added two new values to the <gender> element: "transgendered male-to-female", and
     "transgendered female-to-male".
     MRB: Mon 03-Mar-2014: Revised the <relations> element section's interface annotation code.
     MRB: Sat 01-Mar-2014: Eliminated the <access> element.
     MRB: Mon 18-Feb-2014
     * Deleted child elements of the <note> element, the <access>, <p>, and <projectId> elements, and also made
     these changes in the interface annotation code; deleted the <note> element attributes of @xml:id and @xml:lang
     from the interface annotation code; and allowed text content to be written to the <note> element text node.
     * Removed three "hidden" interface annotation code elements: the <accessCondition>, <recordChangeDate>, and
     <recordCreationDate> elements.
     MRB: Thu 16-Jan-2014: Added an originInfo/recordOrigin element.
     MRB: Tue 07-Jan-2014: Revised and added to place entity section.
     MRB: Mon 06-Jan-2014: Revised the <recordCreationDate> and <recordChangeDate> elements.
     MRB: Fri 27-Dec-2013: Revised and added to place entity section.
     MRB: Wed 18-Dec-2013: Added @url attribute to provide a link to various server-side lists of values.
     MRB: Mon 16-Dec-2013: Added additional interface annotation code.
     MRB: Mon 09-Dec-2013: Added interface annotation code for various elements and attributes.
     MRB: Thu 05-Dec-2013
     * Revised <personRef>, <organizationRef>, and <placeRef> elements so that relation references now can refer to a
     repeatable child element of <name> as well as a repeatable child element of <uri>.
     * Added an <accessCondition> element, along with its required attribute @type, and its optional
     child element <a>, which has a required attribute of @href and an optional attribute of @rel.
     MRB: Tue 19-Nov-2013: The <access> element in the XPath /cwrc/entity/*/recordInfo/access has been eliminated and will
     be replaced with the <accessCondition> element in the XPath /cwrc/entity/*/recordInfo/accessCondition.
     MRB: Mon 28-Oct-2013
     Revised the following:
     * Changed <standardDate> from a required element to an optional element.
     * Changed <note><access> from a required element to an optional element.
     MRB: Mon 09-Sep-2013: Revised <relation> element section so that relation references to person and organization follow
     the approach adopted in the placeRef/uri approach, i.e., now have personRef/uri and organizationRef/uri.
     MRB: July 2013: The entity schema now includes the person, organization, and place entity types; i.e., a place entity
     code section was developed.  The title entity is defined by the MODS schema mods.xsd.  The events entity schema will
     eventually be developed in RDF by JS.
